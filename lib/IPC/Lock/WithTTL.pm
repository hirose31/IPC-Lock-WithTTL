=head1 NAME

IPC::Lock::WithTTL - run only one process up to given timeout

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IPC::Lock::WithTTL;
    
    my $lock = IPC::Lock::WithTTL->new(
        file          => '/tmp/lockme',
        ttl           => 5,
        kill_old_proc => 0,
       );
    
    my($r, $hb) = $lock->acquire;
    
    if ($r) {
        infof("Got lock! yay!!");
    } else {
        critf("Cannot get lock. Try after at %d", $hb->{expiration});
        exit 1;
    }
    
    $lock->release;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

IPC::Lock::WithTTL provides inter process locking feature.
This locking has timeout feature, so we can use following cases:

    * Once send an alert email, don't send same kind of alert email within 10 minutes.
    * We want to prevent the situation that script for failover some system is invoked more than one processes at same time and invoked many times in short time.

=head1 DETAIL

=head2 SEQUENCE

    1. flock a heartbeat file (specified by file param in new) with LOCK_EX
       return if failed to flock.
    2. read a heartbeat file and examine PID and expiration (describe later)
       return if I should not go ahead.
    3. update a heartbeat file with my PID and new expiration.
    4. ACQUIRED LOCK
    5. unlock a lock file.
    6. process main logic.
    7. RELEASE LOCK with calling $lock->release method.
       In that method update a heartbeat file with PID=0 and new expiration.

=head2 DETAIL OF EXAMINATION OF PID AND EXPIRATION

Format of a heartbeat file (lock file) is:

    PID EXPIRATION

Next action table by PID and expiration

    PID       expired?  Next action      Description
    =========================================================================
    not mine  yes       acquired lock*1  Another process is running or
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  exited abnormally (without leseasing
    not mine  no        return           lock).
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    mine      yes       acquired lock    Previously myself acquired lock but
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  does not release lock.

    *1 try to kill another process if you enable kill_old_proc option in new().

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new>($args:Hash)

    file => Str (required)
      File path of heartbeat file. IPC::Lock::WithTTL also flock this file.
    
    ttl  => Int (default is 0)
      TTL to exipire. expiration time set to now + TTL.
    
    kill_old_proc => Boolean (default is 0)
      Try to kill old process which might exit abnormally.

=item B<acquire>(ttl => $TTL:Int)

Try to acquire lock. ttl option set TTL to expire (override ttl in new())

This method returns scalar or list by context.

    Scalar context
    =========================================================================
      Acquired lock successfully
        1
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Failed to acquire lock
        0
    
    List context
    =========================================================================
      Acquired lock successfully
        (1, { pid => PID, expiration => time_to_expire })
        PID is mine. expiration is setted by me.
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Failed to acquire lock
        (0, { pid => PID, expiration => time_to_expire })
        PID is another process. expiration is setted by another process.

=item B<release>()

Update a heartbeat file (PID=0 and new expiration) and release lock.
